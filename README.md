# README

This repo contains my solutions to the developer test at Academy Mortgage.

There is a Ruby on Rails project that was my first attempt at a solution.
I quickly learned that Rails was far to opinionated to allow for successful solutions.
But passes the "Hello, World!" spec.

To Run the Rails project, clone the project, bundle install with the latest bundler.

Next are Ruby programs that run the rest of the tests.
questions3-4-5.rb
question6.rb
question7.rb
and one for extra credit prefix_evaluate.rb that goes beyond the scope for question6.

I can be reached at 435-770-7799 or bobcook@sunrem.com
